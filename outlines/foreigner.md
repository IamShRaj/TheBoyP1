Outlines----

The normal start of the class. There was some short of competition organised in our school. Students from other school came there to participate in the contest. Sh was in the volley ball competition. But his friend wanted to get the seat in the volleyball competition . Sh left the seat and also requested to PET Teacher that to write his friends name instead because his friend wanted to impress a girl in another school. Now Sh has to stay in the school.

So, PET Teacher said Sh that to Join the **Chess Game**. You also play chess better. Sh said Yes.&#x20;

Chess competition venue was his school self. So he Started preparing for it.&#x20;

The match day was today many school students came there. Sh's first match was with a good player Sh lost, Now Sh enters the knockout stage for 2 matches if he lose he will not able to qualify. Sh has to win every match now, Qualified Students will go to different place/School for state level championship.

Sh won the next two matches  he need to qualify the final match that was between him an harshita.&#x20;

Sh said this is unfair, The fixing of matches isn't good I'm competing with my school student, he complained to PET Teacher that they want that in state level less students from our school should go so this is there strategy to eliminate our school players.

A girl from another school named Aarohi ( She was damn hot ) also faced same thing to compete with there own school student. She said that we should switch opponents and we will face each other school. But Organisers deny.

Sh wanted to go to other school with harshita because she was also a good player and if they will play the final separately they she must won and then happy.

But SH played with harshita Sh tried to lose the game. But harshita understood the she is losing but Sh don't want her to lose so She said bro play well you can't beat a girl, Sh won. Sh wasn't feeling well because She said his bro - A talk of Sh with his friend, So he decided to win.



Now, Sh has goto another school for state level championship, Aarohi also won her match.



Next day they have to go. Sh was in <mark style="color:yellow;">canteen in the evening.</mark> Having fun with friends. Suddenly group of girls appear there, fight for for the seat b/w the boys and the girls Aarohi was there. Sh wanted to give the seats but his friend was fighting to he has to support but in background he was telling his frinds to quit. The girls are here for temporary. Aarohi was there. She said Hi, Sh...

All of his friends started seeing Sh. It wasn't common that Sh is talking to girls.- fun happened -

Now, Sh friend invited the girls and stopped fighting because now they are saying that Aarohi is her bhabhi So they said and talked good. Sh giving party to boys and Aarohi to Girls for the selection of state level championship.

After the party happened at canteen. Sh and Aarohi was walking on the street of school. Near the girls hostel. Because girls aren't allowed to go further, they are talking about chess. <mark style="color:yellow;">Sh was a Shy and Introvert person for girls</mark>. But this is the first time any girl is taking to Sh like that because Aarohi was a frank girl and she talk to everyone frankly. Sh also crushed Anne Frank #ff.

Sh after talking about here and there, Sh is felling free with Aarohi.
