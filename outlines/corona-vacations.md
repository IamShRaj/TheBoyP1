It was heartbreaking not scary.

There was the time of corona when corona was at peak maybe 2021. It was the second time schools are getting closed for no time limit. After when I was in class 10th in 2020. Our fairwell was not celebrated because a new disease was found named corona. Schools are getting vacations and we was chill thinking that this is a normal virus. But Corona was going to give us a deep wound in our hearts. Thats a different story. Maybe I will talk later.

But it was the second time we was going home back. But this time I wasn't happy and I had a crush to think about.



#### Getting Instagram Id

I know that she has an instagam account. I wanted to get her photos and I really wanted them to see. I wanted that thing so deeply.
