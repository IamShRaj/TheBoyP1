## Story

There was raining that day. I was with my friend enjoying the chips and mango juice purchased from the school canteen and the rain that was awesome. I seen under the shade harshita was meeting to her parents. They came after travelling a long distance from Gujrat.

She was happy and enjoying the meet with her parents and her little brother. I seen her family that was cute I said to my friend. My friend said "Everything looks cute when you are in love, and I think face of her is different from his father may be neighbour support made her alive" and he started laughing. I didn't found it funny.

### Talk with her brother

I said lets try to talk to her brother(My Sala).&#x20;

As we made our way towards her, her brother, a curious little fellow, was roaming around, occasionally staring at the droplets of rain falling on the ground. I caught his attention and asked him how he felt about the rainy weather. He had forgotten where he was for a moment, his mind caught up in whatever game he had been playing in his head. He smiled and eagerly shared his fascination with the countless ripples each raindrop made.

#### Going to the Playground

The rain eventually subsided enough for us to venture to the playground. The scent of wet earth lingered in the air as we headed there. Children were already swinging and sliding, their laughter mingling with the sound of the remaining droplets hitting the leaves.

#### Eye Contact with Her

As I was watching the children play, I noticed Harshita walking towards the playground as well. Our eyes met, and for a moment, it was like the world around us stood still. There was something unspoken in that glance, a sort of silent communication that conveyed more than words ever could.

#### An Unexpected Conversation

As her gaze held mine, I mustered up the courage to approach her. Despite the playful screams and the cacophony of playground noise, our conversation began with a quiet, almost timid "hello."

**Chatting Amidst the Laughter**

We spoke about simple things at first—the rain, the joy it brought to the kids around us, and the freshness it added to the air. The connection felt natural, and slowly the initial awkwardness melted away.

**Sharing A Moment**

The playground's ambient noise faded into the background as we shared stories, laughed, and enjoyed the moment. Time seemed to slow down, and in that instant, I felt a sense of serenity and happiness.

At last talking to her was in my imagination and I never talked to her. Still waiting.

#### Lingering Thoughts

As I stood there amidst the cacophony of children's laughter and the occasional chirp of a bird, I realized that my courage had not risen to the occasion. The words I wanted to say to Harshita remained unspoken, like a poem forgotten in a dream.

#### Reflection

The rest of the day passed by in a blur. The image of Harshita's smile and the depth of her eyes lingered with me. I found myself wondering about the countless stories her eyes seemed to hold.

#### The Rain's Lesson

The rain brought many things that day: the freshness in the air, a time to share with friends, and a lesson in courage. I learned that sometimes, the moments we let slip away are the ones we most wish we had captured.

#### Evening Reflections

Back in the serenity of my hostel room, I watched as the raindrops raced each other down the window pane, lost in thoughts of Harshita. Lying on my bed, the rhythmic patter of rain accompanied my reverie, each drop a reminder of what could have been.

The quiet was soon disrupted by my friends' voices, their laughter piercing the solitude as they captured the rainy essence in selfies on the balcony. We captured lot of photos. As the rain ceased, a rainbow painted the horizon, signaling a transition to a beautiful evening, perfect for indulging in the warmth of pakoras.

As the evening unfolded, our attention was momentarily seized by the unexpected visit of our teacher's attractive daughter. Her beauty seemed to captivate them all, yet my thoughts lingered on Harshita. She possessed an allure that was undeniable, and soon my friends were overtly admiring her grace. We engaged in light-hearted banter, each one throwing a comment her way in admiration of her beauty. The laughter crescendoed when one friend playfully chided me for straying with my gaze. "Focus on Harshita, why look at her?" he teased. My response came wrapped in humor, "This is just a part-time job, bro. Harshu is the base model." The jest was met with laughter, but it was clear where my thoughts truly resided.

**Evening Routine at the Mess**

As the time for evening snacks arrived, I made my way to the bustling mess. Girls congregated, collecting their treats, and amidst them, I searched for Harshita's familiar presence. She belonged to Nilgiri House, and her association had strangely made me grow fond of the color green – her house color. Since meeting her, **every shade of green caught my attention**, and sorting through the crowd had become almost instinctual. Yet, that day, she was nowhere to be seen, and a wave of disappointment washed over me.

To ease the sting of her absence, I indulged in more pakoras, courtesy of Sushila Didi at the mess – our seniority at school had its perks. With a heavy heart and a plate full of snacks, Ashwin, my bench partner, and I retreated to the open fields.

As evening unfurled, the backdrop was filled with students' voices mingling with the sounds of games and playful banter. Ashwin and I discussed everything from classes to the looming exams, interspersed with light teasing about his affection for Priyanka, a student from Harshita's class.

Suddenly, our attention was diverted to a group of students crafting an effigy – a putla of our principal madam. Although it was done in jest rather than malice, they went about the mock-abusive chants with a spirited fun, preparing the putla for the Holika Dahan.

Realization dawned that Holi was upon us, and with the Holika Dahan underway, it meant the girls, including Harshita, would invariably attend. My spirits lifted at the thought, and festivity took over. Ashwin and I joined in with the others, hands linked, encircling the soon-to-be-lit Holika, heartened by tradition and the anticipation of seeing her.

As dusk approached, and the junior students initiated the Holika's flames, the night came alive with the heat of the fire and the warmth of shared celebrations.

**Holi Anticipation**

* Anticipating seeing Harshita at the Holika Dahan added a silver lining to the event.
* Despite the day's setbacks, the evening held promise.
* Joined in the pre-Holi festivities with an elevated sense of camaraderie.

**Evening Antics Amidst Flames.** As the fire licked the sky and shadows danced around us, the energy of the students, alight with excitement for the forthcoming festival of colors, was infectious. We swayed around the blazing Holika, chants and cheers blending with the crackling wood.

**Glimpses of Green and Hopes of Meeting Harshita.** With every flash of green, my heart skipped, hoping to catch a glimpse of Harshita in the crowd. The night was filled with laughter and the scent of burning wood, a stark contrast to my earlier solitude, but it was her presence that I yearned for.

**The Warmth of Holi.** The radiance of the Holika fire seemed to carry the warmth of friendships and new beginnings. As the flames soared higher, so did my hopes of celebrating Holi with a dash of green, the color that had unexpectedly painted my world with the hues of anticipation.

**A Night Cloaked in the Spirit of Holi** As the evening drew to a close, the juniors' excitement at igniting the fire resonated with my own. The Holika Dahan wasn't just a ritual; it was a prelude to the vibrant festivities of Holi, where perhaps, I would finally get to share a moment with Harshita.

* and I seen her from a distace, pet mam was not allowing them to come closer,
* we celebrated the holika in the night, _CIRCUMAMBULATION ,_now the had night started
* while celebration i found that the girls are throwing some cards and pages into the holika, after asking i found that this is a ritual in which after writing the bad thoughts or if you hate someone write bad things about her and burn it in holika .&#x20;
* For fun we started to save some pages or cheats from being burned, and desided to read that later and we fond so many funny things my roomates and me were enjoying that, Ashwin gone he was a good and innocent(may be) person so he was not with us.&#x20;
* the cheats were so funny girls written bad things about there best friends also, muh me ram bagal me churi that was humurous one boy justt catched the slip while a girl was throwing and after some noke jhokand reading it he throgn it to holika, knowing other secrets is bad may be



**A Chance Encounter**. As the flames of the Holika rose into the night sky, my eyes caught a glimpse of her in the distance. The physical education teacher, vigilant as ever, kept the girls from getting too close to the fire, but that did nothing to dampen our spirits. The night was alive with the energy of the festivities, and we performed the traditional circumambulation around the Holika, embracing the warmth and the light of the fire.

**The Ritual of Burning Sorrows**. Amid the celebration, I noticed the girls tossing small cards and scraps of paper into the fire. Upon inquiry, I learned about the ritual where one writes down their negative thoughts or grievances about someone and burns them in the Holika. It was believed to be a symbolic act of letting go of negativity and starting anew.

**Collecting Secrets**. Intrigued and looking for a bit of amusement, we decided to rescue some of these notes from the fire to read later. Many of them were surprisingly candid and humorous, exposing the lighter side of school friendships. "Mouth says 'Ram,' hand holds a knife," one read, capturing the essence of harmless duplicity. Another blazed into ashes as a boy snatched it mid-air, only to release it back into the Holika after a playful scuffle – some secrets, after all, are better left unknown.

**Reflections on a Joyful Night**. The night was one of camaraderie and laughter, especially when my roommates and I sifted through the saved notes. Ashwin, ever the innocent soul, had left earlier, not one to partake in such mischievous activities. As the fire died down and the stars claimed the sky, our hearts were full, and our excitement for the upcoming Holi celebrations had only just begun.
