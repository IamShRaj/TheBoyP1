# From Home

(Verse 1) Upon leaving home, down the road I stroll, Her house appears, emotions take control. Breath halted, heart in a bind, Expressions trapped, words hard to find.

(Pre-Chorus) Can't say it myself, let someone tell, In her lane, where evenings swell. As I walk a bit, her house draws near, In those moments, my joy and fear.

(Chorus) I try a hundred ways to express, But silence lingers, a deep distress. All night sitting, forgetting all, When I pass by, memories recall. When I see her, world fades away, In her presence, my heart's sway.

(Verse 2) Maybe tomorrow, on the street we'll meet, Stop her footsteps, her heart to greet. Ask what's hidden, what's concealed, The truth of emotions, soon revealed.

(Pre-Chorus) But now I hear, she's no longer there, City's empty, echoes of despair. Still, I go, repeating the quest, Hoping for news, in my heart's unrest.

(Chorus) I try a hundred ways to express, But silence lingers, a deep distress. All night sitting, forgetting all, When I pass by, memories recall. When I see her, world fades away, In her absence, my heart's dismay.

(Bridge) Empty streets, a lingering doubt, Yet I walk, shadows of hope about. Repeating the journey, echoes persist, In the silence, emotions resist.

(Verse 3) Upon leaving home, down the road I tread, Her house in sight, memories widespread. In the city's emptiness, I roam, Seeking solace, longing for home.

(Outro) But still, I go, down the familiar lane, Hoping love's news will break the chain. Upon leaving home, as I walk this street, Her house remains, a memory sweet.
