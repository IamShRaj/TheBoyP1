# Try to See You

(Verse 1) Out from my class, through the window I gaze, Your class in view, in a silent daze. Every time, I hope to see, You stepping out, just once, let it be.

(Pre-Chorus) Always on the first bench, you reside, In your presence, my feelings abide. I pass your class, a hopeful glance, Trying to catch your eyes, a subtle trance.

(Chorus) A hundred times, I've tried to convey, Through the window, my heart's display. Silent moments, in my own way, Hoping you notice, each passing day.

(Verse 2) In the corridor, where our paths align, I choose your class, a decision divine. Hoping you'll emerge, and our eyes will meet, A fleeting connection, oh, so sweet.

(Pre-Chorus) Always on the first bench, you're there, In my thoughts, you're everywhere. I pass your class, a hopeful glance, Trying to catch your eyes, a subtle trance.

(Chorus) A hundred times, I've tried to convey, Through the window, my heart's display. Silent moments, in my own way, Hoping you notice, each passing day.

(Bridge) The classroom echoes with silent yearning, My heart's whispers, steadily churning. Hoping one day, fate will allow, Our eyes to meet, and secrets avow.

(Verse 3) Out from my class, the routine persists, Your class, a realm where my heart insists. Through the window, my gaze prevails, In the hope of catching those hidden tales.

(Outro) So I pass by, each and every time, Choosing your class, a silent paradigm. Out from my class, in this subtle dance, Hoping you notice, our fleeting chance.

(Verse 1) In the assembly, dreams unfold, Marrying you, a story to be told. Holding hands, our future gleams, In your eyes, my life's sweetest dreams.

(Pre-Chorus) Talking someday, sharing our tales, In your calm presence, love prevails. Your friends, a mystery unseen, Loyalty stands, a promise serene.

(Chorus) Dreaming of you, my heart's endeavor, From kids to kids, a bond to treasure. Near the water cooler, in winter's chill, I wait for you, time standing still.

(Verse 2) Lonely nights at the hostel, empty at home, Without you, solitude roams. Eyes on the door, a hopeful glance, Hoping for our eyes to meet in a dance.

(Pre-Chorus) In the mess, lines align, Matching with yours, a subtle sign. Taking food together, time entwined, Happening so often, a connection defined.

(Chorus) Dreaming of you, my heart's endeavor, From kids to kids, a bond to treasure. Near the water cooler, in winter's chill, I wait for you, time standing still.

(Bridge) Lingering thoughts, secrets untold, A silent tale, a love to unfold. Wondering if you notice, if you see, Or if in front of your friends, you mention me.

(Verse 3) In the classroom, under the laughter's guise, You and I, a world that lies. Love me, love me not, uncertainty sways, In your gaze, my heart conveys.

(Outro) I'll sacrifice what I can for this chance, To share my secrets in a sweet romance. Love's mystery, a flower to be plucked, In this dance of hearts, forever tucked.

(Verse 1) On a romantic evening in autumn's embrace, We sit on a park bench, hearts in a race. The rustling leaves whisper a sweet melody, Your presence beside me, pure ecstasy.

(Pre-Chorus) In that dress, you wear the hues of the fall, Uncontrollable feelings, love's sweet call. Eyes locked, a connection so deep, In this moment, our souls take a leap.

(Chorus) I love you, a whispered refrain, In the autumn air, love's domain. The park is our stage, the leaves our confetti, Wrapped in your love, an eternal serenity.

(Verse 2) The golden sun sets, painting the sky, Reflecting the warmth in your beautiful eyes. As daylight fades, and stars take their place, Our love story unfolds in the moonlit grace.

(Pre-Chorus) In that dress, a vision so divine, You captivate my heart, forever thine. Uncontrollable emotions, a fervent plea, In this autumn evening, just you and me.

(Chorus) I love you, echoes in the silent air, A pledge of love, beyond compare. The park is our haven, where love's seeds sow, In the autumn breeze, our hearts aglow.

(Bridge) Leaves dance around us, a love ballet, On this romantic evening, forever to stay. Whispers of love, like the autumn breeze, In your presence, my heart finds ease.

(Verse 3) As the night deepens, a tranquil hush, Our love story, an intimate brush. Hand in hand, we face the unknown, In this autumn serenade, our love has grown.

(Pre-Chorus) In that dress, you're a vision so rare, Uncontrollable love, beyond compare. Eyes locked, a promise in the night, In this autumn's embrace, our love takes flight.

(Chorus) I love you, the anthem of our affair, In the park, our love story we declare. Under the moonlight, where dreams align, In this romantic evening, forever thine.

(Verse 1) Upon leaving class, down the hallway I stroll, Her class in view, emotions take control. Breath halted, heart in a bind, Expressions trapped, words hard to find.

(Pre-Chorus) Can't say it myself, let someone tell, In her class, where evenings swell. Always on the first bench, you reside, In your presence, my feelings abide.

(Chorus) I try a hundred ways to express, But silence lingers, a deep distress. All night sitting, forgetting all, When I pass by, memories recall. When I see her, world fades away, In her presence, my heart's sway.

(Verse 2) Maybe tomorrow, on the street we'll meet, Stop her footsteps, her heart to greet. Out from my class, through the window I gaze, Your class in view, in a silent daze.

(Pre-Chorus) Holding hands, our future gleams, In your eyes, my life's sweetest dreams. Always on the first bench, you're there, In my thoughts, you're everywhere.

(Chorus) Dreaming of you, my heart's endeavor, From kids to kids, a bond to treasure. Near the water cooler, in winter's chill, I wait for you, time standing still.

(Bridge) Empty corridors, a lingering doubt, Yet I walk, shadows of hope about. Lingering thoughts, secrets untold, A silent tale, a love to unfold.

(Verse 3) Out from my class, the routine persists, Your class, a realm where my heart insists. In the assembly, dreams unfold, Marrying you, a story to be told.

(Pre-Chorus) In the mess, lines align, Matching with yours, a subtle sign. Lonely nights at the hostel, empty at home, Without you, solitude roams.

(Chorus) Dreaming of you, my heart's endeavor, From kids to kids, a bond to treasure. Near the water cooler, in winter's chill, I wait for you, time standing still.

(Bridge) Leaves dance around us, a love ballet, On this romantic evening, forever to stay. Whispers of love, like the autumn breeze, In your presence, my heart finds ease.

(Verse 4) On a romantic evening in autumn's embrace, We sit on a park bench, hearts in a race. In that dress, you wear the hues of the fall, Uncontrollable feelings, love's sweet call.

(Chorus) I love you, echoes in the silent air, A pledge of love, beyond compare. The park is our haven, where love's seeds sow, In the autumn breeze, our hearts aglow.

(Outro) As the night deepens, a tranquil hush, Our love story, an intimate brush. Hand in hand, we face the unknown, In this autumn serenade, our love has grown. In the park, our love story we declare, Under the moonlight, where dreams align, In this romantic evening, forever thine.
