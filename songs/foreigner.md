# Foreigner

(Verse 1) In the quiet of the classroom, a foreign gaze, A subtle seduction, caught in the maze. Knocked off the volleyball seat, a twist of fate, Into the chess game, where love would await.

Lost in the chessboard, a match was played, Harshita, a rival, Sh's heart displayed. Unfair fixing, a protest made, A strategy to eliminate, in the chess charade.

(Chorus) But in the midst of the game, a love story unfolds, Aarohi's eyes, a tale that molds. Sh's heart entangled, in a web so bold, Love blooming, as the chess pieces are told.

(Verse 2) Aarohi from afar, facing the same plight, Against her own school, a challenging fight. Denied the switch, destiny aligned, Sh and Aarohi, hearts intertwined.

A party in the canteen, chaos and cheer, Friendship blossoming, drawing near. Aarohi, the bhabhi, peace declared, A celebration of love, the bond repaired.

(Chorus) In the midst of the game, a love story unfolds, Aarohi's eyes, a tale that molds. Sh's heart entangled, in a web so bold, Love blooming, as the chess pieces are told.

(Bridge) Walking through the school streets, near the hostel gate, Aarohi and Sh, a connection innate. H\&T whispers, in the moonlit air, Sh's introverted heart, laid bare.

(Verse 3) Talking of likes and dislikes, Navodaya tales, Aarohi's frankness, a love that sails. Unexpected conversations, a shy heart soared, In the symphony of love, a sweet accord.

Separating with a promise, "Milte hai Regional me," Next day, on the bus, a journey to see. Sh packed and ready, no friends in tow, Only Aarohi, a seed to sow.

(Chorus) In the midst of the game, a love story unfolds, Aarohi's eyes, a tale that molds. Sh's heart entangled, in a web so bold, Love blooming, as the chess pieces are told.

(Outro) On the road to the regional, emotions in sway, Sh and Aarohi, love finding its way. Chess pieces on the board of love, they align, In the melody of romance, where hearts intertwine.
